# IDoTheBlacklist

## Overview

IDoTheBlacklist is a Minecraft server-side mod that enhances server security by integrating with a centralized blacklist API. This mod automatically checks connecting players against a list of known problematic users, preventing them from joining the server. It is part of a broader ecosystem managed by IDoTheBot, which is used to manage and maintain community integrity across multiple Minecraft communities and related Discord servers.

## The Blacklist System

The blacklist is a critical tool used to maintain a positive and secure environment across the Minecraft communities associated with IDoTheBot. Here's how it works:

*   **Centralized API:** The blacklist data is stored and managed through a centralized API endpoint.  This ensures that all participating servers have access to the most up-to-date information.
*   **IDoTheBot Integration:** IDoTheBot is used to manage this blacklist.  Authorized users can add or remove entries from the blacklist via specific commands within the Discord server.
*   **Minecraft Mod Integration:** The IDoTheBlacklist mod reads this blacklist data and denies entry to any player found on the list.

### Transparency and Collaborative Management

One of the key principles behind the IDoTheBlacklist system is transparency and collaborative management.

*   **Open Source Code:** Because this code is open source, the workings of the blacklist system are visible to the public. This allows for scrutiny and improvement by the community.
*   **Authorized Users:** A specific set of Discord users is authorized to modify the blacklist. The list of authorized users is also transparent, providing accountability.
*   **Community Review:** Any proposed changes to this mod, particularly those related to the blacklist functionality, must be reviewed and approved by `@IDoTheHax` on Discord before being implemented. This ensures that changes are carefully considered and aligned with community standards.

## Features

-   **Automated Blacklist Checks:** Automatically checks connecting players against a centralized blacklist upon joining the server.
-   **Centralized Ban Management:** Uses an external API to retrieve blacklist data, enabling a network-wide ban system.
-   **Operator Notifications:** Notifies server operators about blacklist checks and any resulting actions.
-   **Configuration:** API key can be set and stored securely to access the blacklist API.
-   **Customizable Disconnect Message:** Displays a clear and informative disconnect message to blacklisted players, including the reason and timestamp.
-   **Logging:** Logs blacklist checks, API responses, and any errors encountered for debugging purposes.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

-   A Minecraft server running Fabric.
-   Fabric Loader installed.
-   An API key from the IDoTheHax Discord server.

### Installation

1.  **Download the Mod:** Obtain the latest release of IDoTheBlacklist from your distribution source (e.g., Modrinth, GitHub Releases).

2.  **Place the Mod:** Place the downloaded `.jar` file into the `mods` folder of your Minecraft server.

    *   If you don't have a `mods` folder, create one in the same directory as your `minecraft_server.jar` file.

3.  **Start the Server:** Start your Minecraft server. Fabric Loader will load the IDoTheBlacklist mod.

## Usage

### Setting the API Key

The IDoTheBlacklist mod requires an API key to communicate with the blacklist API. To set the API key:

1.  **Log in as an Operator:** Join your Minecraft server as an operator. You must have permission level 4 to execute the `/setapikey` command.

2.  **Use the Command:** Use the `/setapikey` command followed by your API key:

    ```
    /setapikey <your_api_key>
    ```

    *   Replace `<your_api_key>` with the API key you obtained from the IDoTheHax Discord server.

3.  **Confirmation:** The server will display a message confirming that the API key has been set successfully.

    *   The API key is stored in the `config/idotheblacklist.json` file on the server.

### Blacklist Checks

-   Once the API key is set, the mod will automatically check players against the blacklist when they join the server.
-   If a player is blacklisted, they will be disconnected with a message indicating the reason and timestamp of the ban.
-   Server operators will be notified of the blacklist check and any disconnects.

## Configuration

The configuration file for IDoTheBlacklist is located at `config/idotheblacklist.json`.

### `idotheblacklist.json`
-   `api_key`: Your API key obtained from the IDoTheHax Discord server. Set this using the `/setapikey` command or manually by editing the file.  Keep this key secure!

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Not Set

-   If the API key is not set, the mod will skip the blacklist check and allow players to join.
-   Server operators will receive a warning message indicating that the API key is not set.
-   Set the API key using the `/setapikey` command as described in the Usage section.

### API Connection Errors

-   If the mod encounters an error while connecting to the blacklist API, it will skip the check and allow players to join.
-   Server operators will receive a warning message indicating that the blacklist check failed.
-   Check the server logs for more information about the error. Ensure that the server can connect to the internet and that the API endpoint is accessible.

### Invalid API Key

-   If the API key is invalid, the API will reject the request, and the mod will skip the blacklist check and allow players to join.
-   Server operators will receive a warning message indicating that the API key is invalid.
-   Verify that you have entered the correct API key using the `/setapikey` command.

### Blacklisted Players Still Joining

-   If a player is blacklisted but is still able to join the server, ensure that the API is functioning correctly and that the player's UUID is present in the blacklist.
-   Check the server logs for any errors or warnings related to the blacklist check.

### Discord Link Not Working

- Make sure the discord link works as expected.
